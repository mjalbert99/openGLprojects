## Intro
This repo is a combination of three major projects I did in openGL. These three projects are loading a skeleton, skin, and animation file and processing them to work together. A cloth simulation that has adjustable wind in the x,y, and z-axis while having ground collision. And lastly, a particle simulator that has adjustable parameters on the environment and particle properties. All these have imgui windows I designed myself.
